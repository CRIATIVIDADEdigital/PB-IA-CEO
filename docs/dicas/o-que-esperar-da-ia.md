# O que esperar da IA

Resumão...

1. Increased Efficiency And Productivity

Consider how AI can help automate repetitive tasks, streamline workflows, and expedite production. While the efficiency and productivity benefits are numerous, they must also be compared to and balanced against the value of current approaches—i.e., just because it’s possible doesn’t mean it’s the right decision for the business. It’s important to weigh the benefits against the risks, including creating a roadmap of where today’s AI investments pay off in the present and the future.

2. Advanced Decision Making

The power of AI is less about the insights it derives and more about the decisioning it enables. With the ability to analyze large data sets at speed, faster time from data to insights is possible. Faster insights should lead to faster decisions and actions, as insights without action are just information on the shelf—interesting, but not helpful. As AI learns over time, predictions will become more reliable.

3. Enhanced Customer Experiences

People expect better and more personalized customer experiences. In recent research from Acxiom, 70% of shoppers want their online experiences personalized. Great personalization is data-driven. When a brand has a strong data foundation and gives AI access to enterprise-wide data sets, AI can help deliver consistent and rapid support, not only virtually through technology-enabled assistants but also by empowering front-line employees with actionable insights that drive positive interactions. In an increasingly global market, AI can help with content localization and communications preferences.
