Pros

Machine Learning, can analyze vast amounts of data, identifying trends and patterns that humans would otherwise miss. 
- AI can help businesses enhance their decision-making, reduce operational costs, and improve customer experiences.
Cons

- AI’s decision-making abilities also bring an increased level of responsibility. 
- Unlike traditional tools, AI can make decisions autonomously. This ability can lead to ethical and legal dilemmas. 
- If an AI makes a mistake, who is **held accountable**? If AI makes a biased decision, **who is responsible**?
